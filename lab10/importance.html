      <h2>Why are Pointer Events Important?</h2> 
      <p>Pointer Events are essential because they allow for a more unified approach to user interaction on the web. Instead of using separate events for mouse, touch, and pen devices, Pointer Events provide a single model for handling all these types of input, leading to cleaner code and less complexity for developers.</p>
      <p>Without Pointer Events, developers would have to write and maintain multiple event handlers to handle different types of input devices. With Pointer Events, a single event can handle a wide range of devices, making web applications more consistent and easier to maintain.</p>
      <p>Pointer Events are also useful in creating smoother interactions on touch devices, as they provide a more accurate way of tracking movements and gestures across various input types. This leads to better performance and a more reliable experience for users.</p>
