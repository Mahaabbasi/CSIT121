      <h2>What are Pointer Events?</h2> 
      <p>Pointer Events are a web standard designed to provide a unified way of handling input from various pointing devices, such as a mouse, touchscreen, or stylus. Unlike traditional mouse and touch events, Pointer Events provide a single model for handling multiple types of user input in a consistent way.</p>
      <p>Pointer Events offer a range of events such as <code>pointerdown</code>, <code>pointerup</code>, and <code>pointermove</code>, which can be used across devices. This reduces the need for different code paths for different devices, making it easier to write cross-device compatible code.</p>
      <p>The Pointer Events model is especially useful for modern web applications that need to support both mouse interactions and touch gestures. By consolidating these into a single event model, developers can handle user interactions more efficiently and create a smoother experience across devices.</p>
