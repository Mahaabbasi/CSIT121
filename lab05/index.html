            <h2>Labs 1 & 2 Reflection</h2>
            <p id="Journey">Navigating the Challenges of Building My First Webpage</p>
            <p>Creating my first webpage was quite challenging at the start due to the many HTML tags and layout rules to learn. It felt overwhelming with so much information to take in all at once. However, by breaking the task into smaller, more manageable steps, I found it easier to understand. Gradually, I learned how to use HTML tags correctly and how to structure a webpage. This methodical approach helped me see how all the parts fit together and how webpages are built and displayed on the internet.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Through persistence and practice, I gained confidence in my web development skills.</p>
