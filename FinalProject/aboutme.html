            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Maha Abbasi, a student pursuing web development. This semester has been an incredible learning journey where I’ve developed new skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design.</p>

            <p>I have created several projects that helped me grow as a developer. Each task presented new challenges, but the satisfaction of seeing the final result always made it worthwhile. Through these projects, I’ve gained a solid understanding of web development concepts and techniques.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            
            <p>Completing this project was both challenging and rewarding. One of my main challenges was working with CSS to achieve the right layout. I struggled with positioning elements correctly and ensuring a responsive design, but with practice, I gained more confidence.</p>

            <p>Seeing my website come together was a major triumph. The process of experimenting with different layouts and refining the code taught me how to approach web design with flexibility and patience.</p>

            <p>Testing on multiple browsers and devices was crucial to ensure my website worked across all platforms. Initially, I faced layout issues when testing on Firefox and Safari, which taught me the importance of browser compatibility.</p>

            <p>I also realized the value of mobile-first design. Ensuring that the website was responsive and functional on both mobile and desktop devices became a key focus as I worked through the project.</p>

            <p>This experience reinforced that testing and debugging are essential parts of the web development process. It also taught me that a website should be consistent and functional across different screen sizes and browsers.</p>

            <p>Throughout this course, I have learned the importance of clean, semantic code and the significance of designing for accessibility. Understanding how to make websites responsive and user-friendly has been one of the biggest takeaways.</p>

            <p>Above all, this course has given me a deeper appreciation for the craft of web development. I’ve not only learned technical skills but also the importance of user experience and design thinking in creating engaging, functional websites.</p>
