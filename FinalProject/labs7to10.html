            <h1>My Web Development Labs - Lab 7 to Lab 10</h1>
            <p>Below are additional lab projects I completed during this semester. These labs cover various topics, including HTML forms, responsive design, JavaScript, and creative webpage layouts.</p>

            <!-- Lab 7 -->
            <div class="lab">
                <h2>Lab 7: Contact Form</h2>
                <p>This lab involved creating a contact form where users can submit their information. I focused on form validation and making sure all input fields work as expected.</p>

            <!-- Lab 8 (Modified version of Lab 4 - Landscape, Lilyflower, Car Pages) -->
            <div class="lab">
                <h2>Lab 8: Modified Landscape, Lilyflower, and Car Pages</h2>
                <p>In Lab 8, I took inspiration from **Lab 4** and enhanced multiple pages showcasing different themes: a landscape page, a lilyflower page, and a car page. I applied more advanced CSS styling and layout techniques to ensure that the site is visually appealing, responsive, and compatible across different devices. The pages feature creative images, proper use of HTML elements, and a consistent layout throughout the site.</p>
